# pretty self explanatory, this will take number of screenshots you want, all evenly spaced depending on how long the video is
# Set this to 0 if you want to upload without taking any screenshots

# Post Processing
# ------------------------------------------------------------ #
# you can specify a "Watch Directory" in some torrent clients that will automatically add new .torrent files to its download queue
# this could be used to automatically start seeding an upload using AutoTools (rtorrent)
#  -- Leave the location blank to disable any sort of movement --  *(Do not delete the keys)*

# Check for dupes (true | false)
# ------------------------------------------------------------ #
check_dupes=true
# 100% matches will always be rejected so you'll need to set 'check_dupes' to 'false' if you insist on uploading a dupe (??)
# ------------------------------------------------------------ #
# ! Lower == Better ! (this is a percentage of similarity between your file and what's already on the tracker)
# Typically 80 filters out most obvious dupes (Don't include the percentage symbol below), if you want to be more cautious you should choose a lower number

# SEE EXAMPLES BELOW
# --------------------------- #
# You're uploading: Atomic Blonde 2017 1080p UHD Bluray DD+ 7.1 HDR x265-NCmt
# Already on site:  Atomic Blonde 2017 1080p UHD BluRay DD+7.1 HDR x265 - HQMUX
# similarity percentage = 84%
# --------------------------- #
# You're uploading: Rogue 2020 1080p Bluray DD 5.1 x264-BHDStudio
# Already on site:  Rogue 2020 1080p BluRay DTS 5.1 x264-iFT
# similarity percentage = 79%
# --------------------------- #
# You're uploading: Get Him to the Greek 2010 1080p Bluray DTS-HD MA 5.1 AVC Remux-EPSiLON
# Already on site:  Get Him to the Greek 2010 Unrated BluRay 1080p DTS-HD MA 5.1 AVC REMUX-FraMeSToR
# similarity percentage = 88%
# --------------------------- #

# auto mode
# ------------------------------------------------------------ #
# Set this to 'False' if you want an interactive & hands on experience
# You'll be prompted to select the correct TMDB ID, Prompted to fix any small issues/discrepancies found during the upload process
# !! It's recommended to keep this set to 'False' !!
auto_mode=False
#
#
# !! THIS ONLY APPLIES IF ^^ "auto_mode=true" ^^  !!
# Set this to 'true' if you want an upload to to be forced through unless a critical issue is found
# e.g. If we can't auto detect 'audio_channels', we can still upload but we'll just omit that part from the torrent title
# But if something like 'resolution' can't be detected then the upload will be cancelled since 'resolution' is a required API/Upload Key
# !! It's recommended to keep this set to 'False' !! (Remember, you are responsible for following all tracker rules!)

# Live / Draft (BHD)
# ------------------------------------------------------------ #
# This only applies to BHD since they are the only site that have a 'draft'/'live on site' option
# Its great for testing and verifying the script submits the correct info before posting it live
#   True == Live on site, everyone can see it
#   False == Goes to your private drafts https://beyond-hd.me/drafts
live=False



# This is required to upload raw bluray discs (.iso not supported)
# download & install docker then clone https://github.com/zoffline/BDInfoCLI-ng
# Inside the project files for BDInfoCLI-ng you'll find a folder called 'scripts' and in it you'll find the file 'bdinfo'
# You want to paste the full system path to that 'bdinfo' file here
bdinfo_script=



# Automated re-uploading (Docker)
# ------------------------------------------------------------ #
# If you're running r(u)torrent in a docker container you will need to map the containers download path to its system path
# (If you are using Sonarr/Radarr then you've already probably done this under "Remote Path Mappings" in the "Download Clients" section)
# e.g.
#     OS System path:           /mnt/local/downloads/torrents/rutorrent/completed/file.mkv
#     Docker container path:    /downloads/torrents/rutorrent/completed/file.mkv
#
#     ------- Using those paths ^^ you would set the mappings like this
#     host_path=/mnt/local/downloads/
#     remote_path=/downloads/
# This allows us to translate the "d.data_path" rtorrent returns to something that this project can access/upload
#
# ------ If you aren't using docker containers for anything and your rtorrent path is the same as your system path, set 'translation_needed' equal to False ----- #
translation_needed=False
